<h2>Postman</h2>

&emsp;About this Repo: In this Repo, I focused on testing public APIs that I found explicitly documented in Swagger. My goal was to familiarize myself with the Postman platform and gain experience to be able to test APIs that I will create in the future. In this regard, this Repo is different from the one dedicated to Golang-APIs, where there are already tests performed in Postman. Instead, here I will post collections exported from the platform, making it easy to verify for anyone interested.
<br>&emsp;Thank you for taking the time to review this GitHub repository. 
<br>I appreciate your interest in my work. ðŸ™‚
